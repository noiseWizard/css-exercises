# Margin and Padding #2

This one is a little nicer looking, and a little closer to something you might see in the real world. You'll need to change a little more than just margin and padding to make it look exactly right.

### Self Check
Use this section to check your work. On _these_ projects, your goal isn't to attain 100% pixel perfection, but to use the tools you've learned to get relatively close to the desired output.

- There is 8px between the edge of the card and its content (the blue sections).
- There is an 8px gap between each of the blue sections inside the card.
- The title of the card uses a 16px font.
- There are 8px between the title text and the edge of the title section.
- The content section has 16px space on the top and bottom, and 8px on either side.
- Everything inside the `.button-container` section is centered, and there is 8px padding.
- The Big Button is centered on its own line.
- The Big Button has 24px space on the sides, and 8px on top and bottom.

### Self Reflect
#### before solution review
made a couple of changes which weren't specified however unsure what the alternatives were for these:
1. card width - increased to 500px from 400px, unsure how else to widen it based on the parameters provided.
2. using text align on the .button-container - i couldn't find a way use margins to properly center the text.

#### after solution review
interesting how the solution didn't include the card width, and when I load the solution, it reverts back to the 400px width. this is an example of me following the directions closer than what's expected.

only other big change I can see is the margin's having the bottom specifically impacted, however this doesn't influence the appearance too much.

the code differences aren't significant enough that I don't feel uncomfortable to progress. it's just a good example of seeing how different kinds of code can have the same or similar results.

also fixed a minor issue with the button margin missing a ;
